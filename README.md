# Insight Box Prototype

## Project Overview
The Insight Box Prototype is a tool designed to analyze simulated journal entries for cognitive distortions. This was submitted and accepted for CHI 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Interaction (https://www.media.mit.edu/events/CHI-2025-Augmented-Reasoning/) for Augmented Reasoning. 

## Repository Structure

- **Insight_box_prototype.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the core code for data processing and analysis. It loads journal entries, detects cognitive distortions, and address the distortions by providing counter reasons to let the user yeild insights into his own mind.
- **simulated_journal.csv**: Example dataset with simulated journal entries. This serves as the input data for testing and demonstrating the prototype.
- **prototype_result.csv**: Output file containing the analysis results. It includes detected cognitive distortions and corresponding insights.
- **CHI_Insightbox_preprint.pdf** : Contains the pre print of the posistion paper submitted for the workshop
